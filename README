This class implements a log facility which can either print on STDOUT
or warn on STDERR (or hide) the log message. But in any case, the log
message will be stored in the class so that all log messages can be
retrieved later by the user.

Suggested DSLI entry :
Puppet::
  LogBody          bdpO  Logging facility                    DDUMONT

Note:

This class does *not* use Tk. If you want a Tk based log facility, you
can use Puppet::Log instead, they have the same interface.

About Puppet body classes

Puppet classes are a set of utility classes which can be used by any object.
If you use directly the Puppet::*Body class, you get the plain functionnality.
And if you use the Puppet::* class, you can get the same functionnality and
a Tk Gui to manage it. 

See the embedded documentation in the module for more details.

Comments and suggestions are always welcome.
